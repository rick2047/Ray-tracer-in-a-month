# Motivation
This is my attempt to make my own implementation of "*Ray Tracing in One Weekend*" by *Peter Shirley* made in julia. Link: https://raytracing.github.io/books/RayTracingInOneWeekend.html

# Catch
I don't know anything about the language, or ray tracing.

# Tasks
I am making it a git repository to document how and why my ideas will change. Here are the things I hope to learn to do in Julia for now. 

- [ ] Reading and writing a file
- [ ] Make images in some standard library
- [ ] Writing unit tests in julia
- [ ] Setting up the IDE for Julia
